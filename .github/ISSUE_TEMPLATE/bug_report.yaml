        ## Additional Data and logs
        Please send an M503 command to your printer, and capture the full communication from OctoPrint's terminal, as well as open your browser to the
        API endpoint `/api/plugin/eeprom_marlin` on your OctoPrint install. This helps me to work out what stage of the process the bug is in. Thank you!
